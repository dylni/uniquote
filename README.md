# UniQuote

This crate allows quoting strings for use in output. It works similarly to
[`str::escape_debug`], but the result is meant to be shown to users. Simply
call [`Quote::quote`] on an argument passed to [`println!`] or a similar macro
to quote it.

One of the primary uses for this crate is displaying paths losslessly. Since
[`Path`] has no [`Display`] implementation, it is usually output by calling
[`Path::display`] or [`Path::to_string_lossy`] beforehand. However, both of
those methods are lossy; they replace all invalid characters with
[`REPLACEMENT_CHARACTER`]. This crate escapes those invalid characters instead,
allowing them to always be displayed correctly.

## Usage

Add the following lines to your "Cargo.toml" file:

```toml
[dependencies]
uniquote = "3.3"
```

See the [documentation] for available functionality and examples.

## Rust version support

The minimum supported Rust toolchain version is currently Rust 1.64.0.

Minor version updates may increase this version requirement. However, the
previous two Rust releases will always be supported. If the minimum Rust
version must not be increased, use a tilde requirement to prevent updating this
crate's minor version:

```toml
[dependencies]
uniquote = "~3.3"
```
